## 2nd Year Engineering Design Project
### Gas flow controller

Code which was made with my friend for our 2nd year Engineering Design Project. Both files are to be run on two different arduinos.

All code can be run by using the Arduino IDE

**Libraries required:**
* Radiohead
* Servotimer2 (Default servomotor library conflicts with RF library)
